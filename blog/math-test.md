# Introduction to Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the foundation of data engineering and machine learning. Today we'll look at some fundamental formulas.

## The Euclidean Norm

The Euclidean norm of a vector $v = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by:

$$
\|v\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2}
$$

## Matrix Multiplication

If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, their product $C = AB$ is an $m \times p$ matrix where:

$$
c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}
$$

## Normal Distribution

The probability density function of a normal distribution is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$
