# My Intention with This Blog

I’ll be honest: I know very little about blogging or how to be a good writer. I also don’t yet know how much time I want to invest in this.

The purpose of this blog is not necessarily to share my thoughts or ideas with the world because I feel they must be heard. While I may do that in the future, I don’t currently feel a strong urge to broadcast opinions or insights for their own sake.

Like many software engineers, I enjoy improving myself in areas beyond my primary domain of expertise. I’ve found that documenting this process—essentially taking structured lecture notes in the form of blog posts—helps me learn more effectively. This blog is meant to serve that purpose.

I would like this blog to be a personal record of my studying with the hope of creating some useful material for others. I also think that blogging or rather writing down about things in general, like journalling, helps me to reflect on my thoughts and ideas.
